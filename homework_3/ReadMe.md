# Homework 3

### Marco Sicklinger, April 2021

## Assignment 1

The first request of the homework is to implement a *custom loss function* for *L1 norm regularization*; three file are provided as answer to this request:

- **`homework_3.ipynb` jupyter notebook:** it is meant as the standard file to submit, in which the requested implementation are built.
- **`regularization.py`:** it is meant to store the implementation of the custom loss function so to be a better tool to test it.
- **`02-sgd-training.ipynb` jupyter notebook:** the notebook from the second lab; it has been chosen as the fastest way to test whether the implemented custom loss function `loss_ReL1()` runs or not.
